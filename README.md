# Motivation
To increase the knowledge of juniors developers so they can find themselves in a better position compared to seniors developers and to list the most frequently commented topics between juniors developers.

# How to Find
Do you want to know more about:
- [Data Types like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hashs... ?](Data-Structure)
- [OOP like Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism... ?](Development-Concepts)
- [Development Concepts like WebService, REST, SOAP, WebSocket, JDBC, JPA, ORM, i18n, l10n... ?](Development-Concepts#general)
- [Development Principles like DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID, GRASP and Clean Code ?](Development-Principles)
- [Architecture Patterns like Dependency Injection, Containers, Gang Of Four ?](Architecture-Patterns)
- [Refactoring like Bloaters, Abusers, Dispensables and how to use them ?](Refactoring)
