# Agile Project Management
- Allows a team to adapt to change in real-time.

# Agile Manifesto
- *Individuals and interactions* over process and tools.
- *Working software* over compreenhsive documentation.
- *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation.
- *Responding to change* over following a plan.
- [See more](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

# Scrum
- Allows teams to deliver milestones as small pieces.
- Based on the lean manufacturing mindset.
- Fail fast = Lean fast.
- Scrum is all about daily collaboration and communication.
- Agree to disagree, but move forward with the decision the teams made.

# Scrum Framework
- The product owner has a prioritized backlog of work for the team to do.
- Every two weeks, the team looks at the backlog and decides what they can accomplish in the next two weeks.
- The team develops and tests their solution to the backlog items until they're done and ready for use.
- At the end of the two weeks, the team demonstrates their accomplishments to the product owner and stakeholders.
- Finally, they reflect on how things went during the two weeks, and they decide what they can do to improve their work practices.

# Key Scrum Roles
**Product Owner**
- "What needs to be done?"

- This business representative is committed 100% to the team. 

- It's their full-time job.

- Review all the work the team completes.

- Either accepts it or asks the team to make changes.

- PO is always ordering the work and ensuring the team members clearly understand the details of the request.

- Interacts with stakeholders.


**Scrum Master**
- "How the team does the work?"

- It was developed to protect the team enough to complete work without distractions.

- This dedicated role also helps them improve their internal team processes.

- Protects the team and the process.

- Keeps the team working at a sustanainable pace.


# Daily Stand-up Meeting
- Scrum also recognizes that if you're going to successfully deliver this quickly, the team  needs to meet every day.
- What did you do yesterday?
- What are you going to do today?
- Is anything blocking your progress?

# Retrospective
- Meeting for the team to reflect on how to improve.

# MVP
- It stands for Minimum Viable Product.
- It is about developing a product just enough to get it out the door to early adopters.

# User Stories
- Detailed, valuable chunk of work a team can quickly deliver.
- Each interaction they have with our product is a use case.
- It tells the team a story about how they're going to use our product. 
- We call these user stories and this is the level of detail we need to know what to deliver.

> "In Scrum you must have fully functional stories completed at the end of every sprint. You're not, however, required to release them to the stakeholders at the end of every sprint. This means you can complete all the work for two or three sprints before releasing the combined results together.

## Bill Wake's Acronym
- **I**ndependent   = It can be delivered separetely from other stories.
- **N**egotiable    = Until the story is committed for work, it can be re-written, changed.
- **V**aluable      = It delivers value to PO, stakeholders and customers.
- **E**stimable     = You must be able to estimate.
- **S**mall         = It must be enough small to be completed in one sprint.
- **T**estable      = It must be a story which needs test.

## Functional and Non-Funct. Story

| Model                         | Example                           | 
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| "user role", I want           | Mobile Customer, I want           | 
| "user requirement", so that   | to create a profile, so that      |
| "desired benefit"             | future orders are faster to place |

- As a **mobile customer**, I want **to create a profile** so that **future orders are faster to place**.

- As a **developer**, I want **to upgrade the database software to the latest version** so that **we have a supported product**.

# Backlog Grooming 
- Is when the product owner and some, or all, of the rest of the team review items on the backlog to ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items,
- Once per sprint.
- It usually happens around the midpoint of the sprint.
- The PO reads the new stories to the team, and the team asks about any details that are missing.
- Your sprint commitment can't be changed once the sprint is underway.

# Roadmap
- Guide showing when themes will be worked on during a time frame.
- It is very high level and is intended to apply your themes over time.
- This way everyone has a general sense of what the focus will be in a given time frame.
- It is inteded to be updated at the end of each sprint.

# Sprint Review
- It is focused on the "product" and maximizing the business value of the results of the work of the previous sprint.
- This is a checkpoint where everyone looks at each story from the sprint and sees which ones were done. 
- Anything that isn't accepted as complete is reviewed, prioritized, and moved out to another sprint.
- Follow this questions:
    - **What did we do?**
    - **What do we still need to do in a future sprint?**
    - **What's ready to show off?**

# Retrospective
- Meeting focused on team perfomance at the end of each sprint.
- Focused on the process and continuous process improvement.
- Follow this questions:
    - **What worked well?**
    - **What did not work well?**
    - **What can be improved?**
